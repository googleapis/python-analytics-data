        r"""Return a callable for the check compatibility method over gRPC.

        This compatibility method lists dimensions and
        metrics that can be added to a report request and
        maintain compatibility. This method fails if the
        request's dimensions and metrics are incompatible.

        In Google Analytics, reports fail if they request
        incompatible dimensions and/or metrics; in that case,
        you will need to remove dimensions and/or metrics from
        the incompatible report until the report is compatible.

        The Realtime and Core reports have different
        compatibility rules. This method checks compatibility
        for Core reports.

        Returns:
            Callable[[~.CheckCompatibilityRequest],

                A function that, when called, will call the underlying RPC
