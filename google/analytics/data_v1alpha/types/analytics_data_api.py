class RunFunnelReportRequest(proto.Message):
    r"""The request for a funnel report.

    Attributes:
        property (str):
            A Google Analytics GA4 property identifier whose events are
            tracked. Specified in the URL path and not the body. To
            learn more, see `where to find your Property
            ID <https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/property-id>`__.
            Within a batch request, this property should either be
            unspecified or consistent with the batch-level property.

            Example: properties/1234
        date_ranges (MutableSequence[google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.DateRange]):
            Date ranges of data to read. If multiple date
            ranges are requested, each response row will
            contain a zero based date range index. If two
            date ranges overlap, the event data for the
            overlapping days is included in the response
            rows for both date ranges.
        funnel (google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.Funnel):
            The configuration of this request's funnel.
            This funnel configuration is required.
        funnel_breakdown (google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.FunnelBreakdown):
            If specified, this breakdown adds a dimension to the funnel
            table sub report response. This breakdown dimension expands
            each funnel step to the unique values of the breakdown
            dimension. For example, a breakdown by the
            ``deviceCategory`` dimension will create rows for
            ``mobile``, ``tablet``, ``desktop``, and the total.
        funnel_next_action (google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.FunnelNextAction):
            If specified, next action adds a dimension to the funnel
            visualization sub report response. This next action
            dimension expands each funnel step to the unique values of
            the next action. For example a next action of the
            ``eventName`` dimension will create rows for several events
            (i.e. ``session_start`` & ``click``) and the total.

            Next action only supports ``eventName`` and most Page /
            Screen dimensions like ``pageTitle`` and ``pagePath``.
        funnel_visualization_type (google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.RunFunnelReportRequest.FunnelVisualizationType):
            The funnel visualization type controls the dimensions
            present in the funnel visualization sub report response. If
            not specified, ``STANDARD_FUNNEL`` is used.
        segments (MutableSequence[google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.Segment]):
            The configurations of segments. Segments are
            subsets of a property's data. In a funnel report
            with segments, the funnel is evaluated in each
            segment.
            Each segment specified in this request
            produces a separate row in the response; in the
            response, each segment identified by its name.

            The segments parameter is optional. Requests are
            limited to 4 segments.
        limit (int):
            The number of rows to return. If unspecified, 10,000 rows
            are returned. The API returns a maximum of 100,000 rows per
            request, no matter how many you ask for. ``limit`` must be
            positive.

            The API can also return fewer rows than the requested
            ``limit``, if there aren't as many dimension values as the
            ``limit``.
        dimension_filter (google.analytics.data_v1alpha.types.FilterExpression):
            Dimension filters allow you to ask for only specific
            dimension values in the report. To learn more, see `Creating
            a Report: Dimension
            Filters <https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/basics#dimension_filters>`__
            for examples. Metrics cannot be used in this filter.
        return_property_quota (bool):
            Toggles whether to return the current state of this
            Analytics Property's quota. Quota is returned in
            `PropertyQuota <#PropertyQuota>`__.
